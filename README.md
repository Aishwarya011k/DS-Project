# StickyCart — DS Project

StickyCart is a playful single-page shopping-cart demo built for a Data Structures project. It showcases a colorful "sticky note" UI and a small client-side cart implementation (JavaScript + HTML + CSS).

## Features

- Product listing with emoji icons
- Client-side cart with quantity controls
- Cart total calculation and checkout confirmation
- Cute UI with responsive layout

## What I changed

- The `checkout()` function now computes the cart total, shows a confirm dialog with the amount, and displays the total in the final thank-you alert before clearing the cart.

## Notes / Next steps

- To persist or process orders, wire the checkout flow to a backend API (example: POST the cart and total to an endpoint).
- If you want, I can add a backend example (Node/Express or a minimal C server using `server.c`) and wire the checkout to it.
